# ☕ Coffee Orders Excel Dashboard Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of global coffee orders using Microsoft Excel. It transforms raw transactional data into a clean, interactive dashboard that showcases key business metrics such as sales by country, product performance, and customer trends. The dashboard is designed for non-technical users and updates automatically through pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic linking.
